HOW TO MODIFY SFIAB Code

James "King of Software" Grant's SFIAB is an amalgamation of about 5 software technologies: PHP, HTML, MySQL, RMail, and 
a lot of mysticism about his technique.

He stores the data into the MySQL database; You craft an email message by accessing an 'emails' entry in the DB like this

-- 
-- Table structure for table `emails`
-- 
--- 1: \note id in the database KEY VALUE
--- 2: val := value?  SECOND KEY
--- 3: name of the email person
--- 4: Description of the email ?
--- 5: from database entry [should be ignored and subsumed by configuration settings]
--- 6: subject of email?
--- 7: the email body to send
--- 8: type of email user [ human ]  or system [ the apache run sysuser ]
--- 9: 

Then you insert values from a user's $_SESSION['id'] into a pro-forma email to be sent out.


He has forms that input into PHP for insertion into database tables.

He uses RMail.php which was buggy and didn't work for us, so it caused a lot of time wasted combined with his unhelpfulness. 

You need to find the data you want in a MySQL table and find which form is used (or what should be used) as the basis for a data entry. 
Then you need to modify the .php to handle the new data.
