I am the Chief Judge for the Southeast Alberta Regional Science Fair around Medicine Hat Alberta ( Canada  ). I convinced the science fair committee to 
adopt the SFIAB code instead of the old paper and pencil system so we could spend less volunteer hours administering and more time working to help kids 
learn about science. 

Adopting the code has not been without problems. I need to show these other skeptical scientists (most from TI-85 era)  that adopting new technology ourselves 
can help make it easier for participants. Techies, please don't let the kids down.

We started working with the latest version sfiab-2.3.0 in about September by getting it installed and working. 

I began in earnest before Christmas 2017 trying to fix things that weren't working or buggy. 

We started out asking James for help but I think supporting other operators is not in Lightbox Technologies interest. 

I am a C/C++ coder more than a PHP and javascript coder. So I am a little slow understanding when he puts things in HTML context.

As you plumb the depths of this code, you will find as I did that James Grant added bits and pieces over 10 years from java, PHP snippets, and so on so the code has lost some coherence.

Basically, these PHP files and add-ons are just wrappers for MySQL calls to insert and select data from the database. Most files are HTML forms. 

If you understand this code and can explain it, any help would be appreciated. Code documentation is also useful. 

If you can fix portions, that would be even greater. 

If you can recommend redesign of part or wholes of this - I am thinking of using https://fatfreeframework.com/3.6/home a light PHP implementation to make the code unified and easier to maintain -
that would also be welcome.
